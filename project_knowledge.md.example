Read this after project_instructions.md at the start of every chat.

## Current State

One paragraph describing the overall health of the project. What is running, what is
stable, what is the primary concern right now.

---

## What Works

A list of things that are confirmed working and do not need attention.

---

## What Is Broken / Unverified

Describe each known issue clearly. For each one include:
- What the symptom is
- What the suspected cause is
- What the first debugging step is

---

## Open Issues

Numbered list of outstanding tasks in rough priority order. Keep descriptions short --
just enough to know what the issue is and what done looks like.

1. First priority issue
2. Second priority issue
3. ...

## Key File Locations

On the server:
  /path/to/project/root/
  /path/to/important/config
  /path/to/service/unit/files

On dev machine:
  /path/to/local/project/
  project_instructions.md  -- how we work (gitignored)
  project_knowledge.md     -- this file (gitignored)

---

## Recent Changes (this session)

A short log of what changed in the most recent session. Replace this at the start of
each new session with what happened in that session. Do not accumulate history here --
that is what git log is for.

---

## Technical Gotchas

The most valuable section. List every non-obvious thing that caused real debugging time.
Format: what the problem is, what the fix is, one line each if possible.

- Thing that bites you if you forget it: how to handle it correctly
- Another gotcha: the correct approach
