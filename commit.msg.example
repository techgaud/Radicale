# Example:
#
# Fix cloudflared credential path in Docker volume mount
#
# The credential JSON was being copied to cloudflared-config/creds/
# but the container expected it at /etc/cloudflared/creds/. The volume
# mount in docker-compose.yml mapped cloudflared-config/ to
# /etc/cloudflared/ correctly, but setup.sh was writing the file one
# level too deep, causing the tunnel to fail to authenticate on start.
#
# Updated the cp command in setup.sh to write directly to
# cloudflared-config/ so the resulting path inside the container
# resolves correctly. Verified by inspecting container logs after
# a clean run of setup.sh on a fresh Ubuntu 22.04 instance.
